Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a second year PhD students at Imperial College London, working under the supervision of Prof. Sebastian van Strien and Dr. Trevor Clark. My project revoleves around understanding the parameter space for families of real cubic polynomials, more specifically what type of dynamical behaviours can we expect for "large" sets of parameters. It is well known that there is an open and dense set of parameters for which the corresponding maps are hyperbolic. This means that all critical points belong to the immediate basin of finitely many attractors, hence the dynamical behaviour is completely understood (in terms of orbits). What about the remaining parameters? Is there a way to understand the dynamic of a generic orbit? These type of questions form the basis of my research,

Check out my blog for more information about what type of mathematics is used in exploring this questions!
