Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a second year PhD student in [Dynamical Systems](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~mrasmuss/DynamIC/ "DynamIC") at Imperial College London, working under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian van Strien](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~svanstri/) and [Dr. Trevor Clark](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/tc6945). 

My project revolves around understanding typical and generic behaviours in families of real cubic polynomials, or in other words what types of dynamical behaviours we can expect for reasonably large sets of parameters. For example, it is well known that in families of polynomial maps there is an open and dense set of parameters for which the corresponding maps are hyperbolic (or Axiom A). This is equivalent to all critical points belonging to the immediate basin of finitely many attractors, and so the dynamical behaviour is completely understood (in terms of orbits). But what about the remaining parameters? Is there a way to understand the dynamic of generic orbits? Can we predict how orbits will distribute? This type of questions are at the core of my research,

Check out my blog for more information about what type of mathematics I am interested in!
